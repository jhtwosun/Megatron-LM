"""MDP checkpoint facade: synchronous global torch_dist save/load.

Logical keys: ``language_model.*`` stays with the decoder chunks (PP/VPP
shards, decoder DP-CP replica metadata, produced by the native checkpoint
path); ``vision_model.*`` comes from the encoder DDP with **encoder WORLD**
replica metadata — one logical copy replicated on every rank. Plans, leaves,
forward handles, autograd graphs, and communication handles are never
persisted.

For static MDP and decoder-only Dynamic-CP, optimizer, LR-scheduler, and RNG
state round-trip through the native paths, so a resume is exact rather than
weight-only; the composite optimizer keeps the two sharding domains apart with
a fixed encoder key (see :mod:`megatron.core.mdp.optimizer`). Repeated-D4
dynamic encoder CP is provisionally weight-only and therefore requires all
native optimizer and RNG save/load paths to be disabled explicitly. What
remains rejected for every MDP checkpoint are the *execution modes* that cannot
work here: the fully-parallel save/load wrappers (they reshard every child over
a single DP-CP group, which is wrong for the encoder's WORLD domain),
asynchronous and non-persistent saves, and constant-structure caching (MDP
rebuilds its plan-derived structures every iteration).
