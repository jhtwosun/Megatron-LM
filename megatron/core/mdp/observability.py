"""MDP structured observability (API design section 20).

Bridge stats come from ``ModalityBridge.last_stats()``; the iteration metrics
are assembled by the runtime at ``end_iteration``. Timing fields measure
completed phase latency, not asynchronous launch latency. Lifecycle facts
(unconsumed handles, non-empty storage) are enforced as invariants at the
iteration boundary, not reported as metrics — they are necessarily zero at a
clean boundary and carry no information as time series.
